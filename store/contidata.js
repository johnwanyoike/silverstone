At the turn of the century Continental balloon fabric was used to seal the gas cells of the first German airship. In 1904 Continental became the first company in the world to develop grooved tires for automobiles, in 1905 we commenced production of rivet anti-skid tires, similar to the later studded tires, and three years later we invented the detachable wheel rim for touring cars. In 1909, French aviator Louis Blériot was the first person to fly the English Channel. The flying surfaces of his monoplane were covered with Continental Aeroplan material."
